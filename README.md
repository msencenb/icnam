### Requirements
iCNAM is written in [Swift](https://www.apple.com/swift/) and requires OS X 10.9 or later.

### Special Thanks
iCNAM uses the [EveryoneAPI Objective-C Library](https://github.com/msencenb/EveryoneAPI) written by [Matt Sencenbaugh](http://sencedev.com/). His library does the heavy lifting, my work just makes it look pretty.
